The World Wide Web.

The World Wide Web (WWW or simply the Web)
is an information system that enables content
sharing over the Internet through user-friendly
ways meant to appeal to users beyond IT specialists
and hobbyists.[1] It allows documents and other web
resources to be accessed over the Internet according
to specific rules of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).[2].
